Welcome to my digital garden! This space serves as a personal wiki where I cultivate and share knowledge, ideas, and discoveries. The concept of digital gardens has evolved significantly over the years[^1], becoming a unique form of personal knowledge management.

## What is a Digital Garden?

Unlike traditional blogs that are organized chronologically, a digital garden is a collection of interconnected notes and articles that grow and evolve over time. Think of it as a personal wiki where thoughts are allowed to develop naturally. This approach, inspired by the work of Mike Caulfield[^2], emphasizes the organic growth of ideas over time.

## Core Principles

### Non-linear Growth
Digital gardens don't follow the traditional chronological format of blogs. Instead, they:
- Allow ideas to evolve naturally
- Encourage frequent updates and revisions
- Support interconnected thinking

### Living Documents
Each piece of content here is treated as a living document that:
- Grows over time
- Gets refined through new insights
- Connects with other related topics

## How to Navigate

The content here is organized in several ways:

1. **Topics**
   - Browse content by theme
   - Explore interconnected ideas
   - Follow concept clusters

2. **Articles**
   - Chronological view of posts
   - Latest updates and additions
   - Featured content

3. **Tags**
   - Find related content
   - Discover connections
   - Track themes across posts

## Writing Style

The content here follows a wiki-style format:
- Clear headings and structure
- Internal links to related topics
- Regular updates and revisions
- Comprehensive references

Feel free to explore and watch this garden grow! Start with the topics that interest you most, and don't hesitate to follow the various connections between articles.
